abstract = "This chapter describes a research study in which a motivational design model – the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) model – was applied in an effort to increase learners’ motivations in two Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in chemistry. The chapter first discusses motivation in learning environments. Then, the related ideas of instructional design, motivational design, and the ARCS model are introduced. MOOCs in general, together with the issues and opportunities they potentially cause and provide, are brie y reviewed. Last, a description of an instructional design study for two chemistry MOOCs is presented with highlights on important design features in the process. The courses incorporated motivational strategies into course emails, course pages, discussion forums, and quiz feedback in the two MOOCs.Students rated attention as the ARCS component with the highest score while relevance had the lowest score. Discussions of the results are provided."
