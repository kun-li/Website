abstract = "This study examined four factors that influence preservice teachers’ intentions to adopt technology in classrooms based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance Model. These four factors—technology self-efficacy, attitudes toward technology, perceived ease of use of technology, and perceived barriers of technology adoption—were explored through a multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that technology self-efficacy, attitudes toward technology, and perceived ease of use of technology were significantly predictive of technology adoption intentions when the other predictors were statistically controlled. Perceived barriers of technology adoption was not a significant predictor. Gender analyses were conducted showing no significant difference on all the factors between male and female. Practical and theoretical implications were addressed either to guide practitioners in designing teacher professional development program or assist researchers in their future study."
