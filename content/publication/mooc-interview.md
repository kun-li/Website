abstract = "Most Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) research studies, especially in early stages, have been focusing on students’ demographics, surveys, and retention data. Far too little attention has been paid to the authentic voices of the learners: the expressions of experiences, perceptions, and emotions in the MOOC students’ own words. In this paper, we conducted and analyzed in-depth interviews with learners from two MOOCs on the same subject. Findings confirm that learners enrolled in MOOCs for career and/or personal purposes. Learners’ expressions of feeling human connection to the instructor in videos had important implications for video editing decisions. Many of the reasons given for dropping out of active participation in MOOCs were related to the learners’ lack of time because of other commitments. We expect the results from this study to provide a new understanding of MOOC learners and their perceptions of the courses; key insights should guide video editing considerations and encourage the use of instructor communication pathways such as regular emails to students in future MOOC offerings."
