abstract = "Though educational researchers have showed increasing interest in studying social annotation tools, few studies have examined the use of social annotation as a peer assessment tool. This study reports how students used social annotation to critique WebQuests created by their peers, and examines their perceived experiences of peer assessment. The findings of the study will have implications for designing social annotation related educational activities and instructional strategies in the future."
