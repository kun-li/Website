abstract = "Researchers have recognized the role that microblogging tools play in enhancing the effectiveness of communication and interaction in the classroom. However, few studies have specifically examined how to use microblogging tools to bring educational resources into the classroom to enrich the student learning experience. The exploratory case study examined an instructional activity designed to expand and deepen student learning experience by having undergraduate students subscribe to, read, and share tweets from high-quality Twitter accounts in the field. The findings suggested that students believed that the activity broadened their knowledge on the topics to be learned, helped them see the connections between coursework and real work, and empowered them with a new tool for learning and inquiry."
