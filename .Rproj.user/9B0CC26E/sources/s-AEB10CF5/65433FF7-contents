abstract = "Massive open online courses serve different needs among learners, from career advancement to interacting with peers to learning about topics of interest. MOOCs can also change student attitudes and increase their engagement with a topic through affective learning, which involves the emotions. Theory-building research at Duke University found four different mechanismsthrough which MOOCs can potentially drive affective learning. This article provides examples of how each mechanism would potentially operateand gives quotes from learners in MOOCs to support these proposed mechanisms."
